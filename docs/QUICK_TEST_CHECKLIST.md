## Critical Tests (15 minutes)

### ✅ Test 1: Carry Over Demo
1. Navigate to **Carry Over** section
2. Click **"Play Demo"**
3. Watch the animation and verify:
   - [ ] Ones column adds correctly (e.g., 7+5=12, shows 2)
   - [ ] Carry "1" appears above tens column
   - [ ] Tens column includes the carry (e.g., 4+8+1=13, shows 3)
   - [ ] Carry "1" appears above hundreds column if needed
   - [ ] Hundreds column includes the carry (e.g., 2+3+1=6)
   - [ ] Final answer is correct (verify with calculator)

**Example to verify:**
```
  247
+ 385
-----
  632  ← Must match!
```

### ✅ Test 2: Carry Over Practice
1. Click **"Practice"** button
2. Note the problem shown
3. Calculate manually on paper
4. Enter carry values (1 or leave blank)
5. Enter answer digits
6. Click **"Check Answer"**
7. Verify:
   - [ ] Correct answers are marked correct
   - [ ] Wrong carries are caught
   - [ ] Wrong answer digits are caught

### ✅ Test 3: Borrowing Demo
1. Navigate to **Borrowing** section
2. Keep clicking **"New Problem"** until you see one starting with 3, 4, or 5 (to test different scenarios)
3. Click **"Play Demo"**
4. Verify:
   - [ ] Borrowed digits are crossed out
   - [ ] Adjusted values are correct (e.g., 3 becomes 2, 2 becomes 12)
   - [ ] Final subtraction is correct

**Critical:** Look for a problem like **300 - 125**:
- [ ] Should show 3̶0̶0̶ becoming 2 9 10
- [ ] Final answer should be 175

### ✅ Test 4: Multiplication Visual
1. Navigate to **Multiplication** section
2. Set sliders to **4 × 5**
3. Count dots in grid:
   - [ ] Should be 4 rows
   - [ ] Should be 5 columns
   - [ ] Total should be 20 dots
   - [ ] Answer shows 20

### ✅ Test 5: Division Visual
1. Navigate to **Division** section
2. Set sliders to **12 ÷ 3**
3. Verify visual:
   - [ ] Shows 12 total items
   - [ ] Grouped into 3 groups
   - [ ] Each group has 4 items
   - [ ] Answer shows 4

## Console Errors to Check

Open browser console (F12) and check for:

- [ ] **Expected:** Immer error about "returned a new value *and* modified its draft"
  - This is known and documented
  - Does not affect mathematical correctness
  - Should be fixed in code

- [ ] **Unexpected:** Any other errors
  - Report these for investigation

---

## Quick Pass/Fail Criteria

**PASS if:**
- ✅ All carry operations show correct carry positions
- ✅ All borrowing shows correct adjusted digits
- ✅ All final answers match calculator verification
- ✅ Practice mode correctly validates correct/incorrect answers

**FAIL if:**
- ❌ Any carry appears in wrong column
- ❌ Any borrow shows wrong adjusted digit
- ❌ Any final answer is mathematically incorrect
- ❌ Practice mode marks correct answer as wrong or vice versa
