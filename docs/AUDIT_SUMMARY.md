## Key Findings

### ✅ Mathematics: EXCELLENT

All mathematical algorithms are **completely correct**:

| Module | Status | Verification |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Carry Over | ✅ PASS | Verified carry position calculation, step-by-step demo logic, and practice validation |
| Borrowing | ✅ PASS | Verified borrow adjustments including cascading borrows (e.g., 300-125) |
| Multiplication | ✅ PASS | Correct multiplication, appropriate 1-12 range |
| Division | ✅ PASS | Clean division (no remainders), appropriate for beginners |
| Number Places | ✅ PASS | Correct place value parsing for thousands through ones |
| Practice Mode | ✅ PASS | Correct problem generation and validation |

### ❌ Code Quality: 1 CRITICAL ERROR

**Redux/Immer State Mutation Error**

**Location:** `/src/store/sessionSlice.ts` lines 207 and 214

**Problem:** Two reducers are both modifying the draft state AND returning a new state object, which violates Immer's rules.

**Error Message:**
```
[Immer] An immer producer returned a new value *and* modified its draft.
Either return a new value *or* modify the draft.
```

**Affected Code:**
```typescript
// Line 205-208 - loadSessionState.fulfilled
.addCase(loadSessionState.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
  state.status = 'succeeded';  // ❌ Modifying draft
  return { ...state, ...action.payload, status: 'succeeded' as const, error: null };  // ❌ Also returning
})

// Line 213-215 - saveSessionState.fulfilled
.addCase(saveSessionState.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
  return { ...state, ...action.payload, status: state.status, error: state.error };  // ❌ Returning
})
```

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Option 1: Only return (no draft modification)
.addCase(loadSessionState.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
  return { ...state, ...action.payload, status: 'succeeded' as const, error: null };
})

.addCase(saveSessionState.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
  return { ...state, ...action.payload, status: state.status, error: state.error };
})

// Option 2: Only modify draft (no return statement)
.addCase(loadSessionState.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
  Object.assign(state, action.payload);
  state.status = 'succeeded';
  state.error = null;
})

.addCase(saveSessionState.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
  Object.assign(state, action.payload);
})
```

**Impact:**
- Currently causes console errors on every page load
- Could lead to unpredictable state behavior
- May affect score tracking and progress persistence

**Priority:** HIGH - Fix immediately

## Detailed Mathematical Verification

### Carry Over Module

**Algorithm Tested:** `calculateCarryPositions()`

**Test Case:** 247 + 385 = 632

| Column | Calculation | Carry Out | Correct? |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Ones | 7 + 5 = 12 | 1 to tens | ✅ |
| Tens | 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 | 1 to hundreds | ✅ |
| Hundreds | 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 | None | ✅ |

**Result:** 632 ✅ CORRECT

**Demo Steps Verified:**
- Step 0: Show problem
- Step 1: Calculate ones (7+5=12), show 2
- Step 2: Show carry to tens
- Step 3: Calculate tens (4+8+1=13), show 3
- Step 4: Show carry to hundreds
- Step 5: Calculate hundreds (2+3+1=6), show 6
- Step 6: Complete - show 632

All steps mathematically correct ✅

### Borrowing Module

**Algorithm Tested:** `calculateBorrowAdjustments()`

**Test Case 1:** 432 - 187 = 245

| Column | Original | After Borrow | Calculation | Correct? |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Ones | 2 | 12 (borrowed from tens) | 12 - 7 = 5 | ✅ |
| Tens | 3→2 | 12 (borrowed from hundreds) | 12 - 8 = 4 | ✅ |
| Hundreds | 4→3 | 3 | 3 - 1 = 2 | ✅ |

**Result:** 245 ✅ CORRECT

**Test Case 2 (Cascading):** 300 - 125 = 175

| Column | Original | After Borrow | Calculation | Correct? |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Ones | 0 | 10 (borrowed, cascaded through tens) | 10 - 5 = 5 | ✅ |
| Tens | 0 | 9 (became 9 during cascade) | 9 - 2 = 7 | ✅ |
| Hundreds | 3→2 | 2 (lent 1 that cascaded) | 2 - 1 = 1 | ✅ |

**Result:** 175 ✅ CORRECT

Cascading borrow logic is implemented perfectly ✅

### Place Value Module

**Algorithm Tested:** `parseIntoPlaceValues()`

**Test Case:** 4,567

| Place | Calculation | Expected | Actual | Correct? |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|----------|
| Thousands | floor(4567/1000) % 10 | 4 | 4 | ✅ |
| Hundreds | floor(4567/100) % 10 | 5 | 5 | ✅ |
| Tens | floor(4567/10) % 10 | 6 | 6 | ✅ |
| Ones | 4567 % 10 | 7 | 7 | ✅ |

All place value calculations correct ✅

## Manual Testing Guide

### Critical Sections to Test

#### 1. Carry Over Section

**Demo Mode:**
1. Navigate to Carry Over
2. Click "Play Demo"
3. Verify each step shows:
   - Correct column addition (including previous carry)
   - Correct carry display (small "1" above next column)
   - Correct answer digit
4. Click individual timeline steps to verify navigation works
5. Generate new problem and repeat

**Practice Mode:**
1. Switch to "Practice"
2. Manually calculate the problem
3. Enter carry values (1 or blank)
4. Enter answer digits
5. Verify "Check Answer" correctly validates both carries and answer

**Expected Results:**
- Carries appear in correct columns
- Answer digits match manual calculation
- Validation catches both incorrect carries and incorrect answers

#### 2. Borrowing Section

**Demo Mode:**
1. Navigate to Borrowing
2. Look for problems with cascading borrows (e.g., X00 - Y##)
3. Verify crossed-out digits and adjusted values are correct
4. Verify final answer is correct

**Practice Mode:**
1. Solve problem manually first
2. Enter answer
3. Verify validation works

**Critical Test:** Find a problem like 300 - 125:
- Verify it shows 2̶3̶0̶0̶ becoming 2 9 10
- Verify answer is 175

#### 3. Multiplication Section

1. Set sliders to various values
2. Count dots in visual grid
3. Verify answer matches grid
4. Test edge cases (1×1, 12×12)

#### 4. Division Section

1. Set sliders to create problem
2. Count groups in visualization
3. Count items per group
4. Verify answer is correct
5. Test that division is always clean (no remainders)
